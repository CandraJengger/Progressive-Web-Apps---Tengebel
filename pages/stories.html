        <h4>Bantarangin Kingdom</h4>
        <p>Bantarangin Kingdom is a kingdom that was once located in the Ponorogo area. The story of the Bantarangin Kingdom became the basis for the Reog Ponorogo storyline. It is told of a king named Raja Klono Sewandhono who fell in love with Putri Kediri named Dewi Songgolangit. Long story short King Klono Sewandhono sent his governor named Pujonggo Anom to propose to Dewi Songgolangit in Kediri for him. When applying for Princess Songgoloangit it turned out that Princess Songgolangit provided several requirements that had to be fulfilled by Raja Klono Sewandhono. And Pujonggo Anom returned to Bantarangin Kingdom and told the conditions given by Princess Songgolangit to Raja Klono Sewandhono. Long story short, all the requirements are ready, only 1 requirement has not been obtained, namely a two-headed animal. Then he Raja Klono Sewandhono decided to go to Kediri to marry Dewi Songgonlangit by bringing a very busy procession, when on a trip when he wanted to enter the City of Kediri, a group of King Klono Sewandhono was attended by a Duke of Kediri who apparently also loved Dewi Songgolangit, he was Singo Barong. There was an extraordinary battle between Klono Sewandhono and Singo Barong, Klono Sewandhono was overwhelmed with Singo Barong because Singo Barong was able to turn into a Lion because it had the Gembong Tiger Ajian. Singo Barong lost and his head fused with a peacock so he became a lion-headed and peacock-headed human. And this fulfills the last requirement to apply for Dewi Songgolangit.</p>
